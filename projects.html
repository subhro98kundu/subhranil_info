			      	<h3 class="text-primary"><b>Amazon Clone Website</b> <span class="text-muted">(Full Stack Web Development)</span></h3>
			      	<small class="mb-1">This is my first full stack web development project. The website is <b>user-interactive</b>. While working on this project I learnt <b>DBMS</b> and how proper queries are made. <b>I learnt how important it is to plan the working flow of a website before starting to code it.</b> This project taught me how to create efficient databases and tables.</small>
				    <small>While planning I divided the project into small modules and kept working on them one by one. This helped me in keeping a track of my progress and made sure that i don't miss out any module. <b>Breaking the project into small modules also made any modification easier.</b></small> 
				    <small>The project was all about planning, writing and debugging thousands of lines of code. I won't bore you with each and every details the code is available on <a href="#">my github, you can check it here.</a> But, here I will like to cover important details in my project.
				    	<ul>
				    		<li>I built a <b>Sign Up module</b> for the website that allows new users to register in the website. While building this module I learnt about registering a new user in the database and how to handle user sessions on the client side.</li>
				    		<li>After that I built a <b>login module</b>. This allowed already registerd users to log into their respective accounts using their email and password. I also took care of security.</li>
				    		<li>Then I created a table for products in the database and I had to plan a lot about the columns of the tables to make it efficient. and after making the table I displayed the products on the web page in various categories as they do in amazon by making queries based on different categories. Well i didn' have a big enough table. So unfortunately it has only four major categories.</li>
				    		<li>Then I coded the <b>Add to Cart module</b>, where if a user is logged in he can add items to his cart. And the items will remain in his/her cart until he/she removes it or purchases it. For this I had to made another table for cart but this table only had 4 columns cart id(primary key), user id, product id and quantity and I linked the table to the products table and the users table with the product id and user id respectively.</li>
				    		<li>Then I created the <b>Purchase Module</b> where the user is allowed to add a delivery address or chose from the ones added by him/her earlier. For this I had to create a table for addresses linked with the users table by user id. I also implemented a dummy payment gateway in the website. And once the order is placed the user can check the status of his order from the orders tab.</li>
				    		<li>After that developed the <b>Review Module</b> where a user can review the products he ordered.</li>
				    	</ul>
				    </small>
				    <small>Cloning each and every feature of amazon was a tough challenge. But as my first project on full stack web development, I tried my best clone maximum of the main features.</small><br><br>

			      	<small class="mb-1">This is a full stack web development project. The website is <b>user-interactive</b>. While working on this project I improved my knowledge in <b>DBMS</b>. <b>I did a thorough planning of the working flow of the website before starting to code it down.</b> In this project I improved my UI skills and implemented a better working UI than my amazon project.</small>
				    <small>While planning I divided the project into small modules and kept working on them one by one. This time my project was more organized than the Amazon one.

				    		<li>After that I built a <b>login module</b>. This allowed already registerd users to log into their respective accounts using their email and password. I also took care of security.</li>
				    		<li>Then I created two separate tables one for restaurants and one for products in the database and I had to plan a lot about the columns of the tables to make it efficient. After making the table I displayed the restaurants on the web page in various categories as they do in zomato by making queries based on different categories. Well this time I have a big enough table. So fortunately I could cover a lot of categories.</li>
				    		<li>Then I coded the <b>Add to Cart module</b>, where if a user is logged in he/she can add food items(menu) to his/her cart. And the items will remain in his/her cart until he/she removes it or purchases it. For this I had to made another table for cart but this table only had 4 columns cart id(primary key), user id, menu id and quantity and I linked the table to the menu table and the users table with the product id and user id respectively.</li>
